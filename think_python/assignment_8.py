# ROT13 is a weak form of encryption that involves “rotating” each letter in a word
# by 13 places. To rotate a letter means to shift it through the alphabet, wrapping around to the
# beginning if necessary, so ’A’ shifted by 3 is ’D’ and ’Z’ shifted by 1 is ’A’.
# Write a function called rotate_word that takes a string and an integer as parameters, and that
# returns a new string that contains the letters from the original string “rotated” by the given amount.
# For example, “cheer” rotated by 7 is “jolly” and “melon” rotated by -10 is “cubed”.
# You might want to use the built-in functions ord, whic
